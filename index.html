<h1>カプセル<sup>⧇</sup></h1>
Kapuseru is the collective name for my audio processing and modular software synthesis components and experiments. 
It is named after the Nakagin Capsule Tower Building (中銀カプセルタワービル, Nakagin Kapuseru Tawā Biru), 
one of the few structures actually built by the Metabolist architeture movement. 
This movement conceived of buildings and cities as living systems of cells combining into larger structures, 
a fitting analogy for the software ecosystems emerging in audio and music.
Kapuseru is the romaji transliteration of the Japanese katakana transliteration of the English word "capsule", 
itself derived from Latin <i>capsula</i> via French.
