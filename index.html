<h1>カプセル<sup>⧇</sup></h1>
Kapuseru is the collective name for my audio processing and modular software synthesis components and experiments. 
It refers to the Nakagin Capsule Tower Building (中銀カプセルタワービル, Nakagin Kapuseru Tawā Biru), 
one of the few structures actually built by the Metabolist architecture movement. 
This movement conceived of buildings and cities as living systems of cells combining into larger structures, 
which is reminiscent of modular software ecosystems in audio and music.
After just over 50 years standing and ten years of unsuccessful efforts to save it, the building was demolished in 2022.
Kapuseru is the romaji rendering of the katakana transliteration of the English word "capsule", 
itself derived from the Latin <i>capsula</i> via French.
